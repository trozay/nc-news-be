# Northcoders News API

This is an api project I built, that gives information, I have inserted into a database. The available end points are /articles, /topics, /users, /articles/comments, /comments/comment_id. The relevant end points also accept queries to sort by any available column, asc/desc, filter down to articles written by a specific author, after or before a date etc. My api is a RESTful server, allowing the user to create,read, update and delete files.
